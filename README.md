## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) - Headless CMS

### What I learned

- First time using Next.JS for a project. Learned about its server side rendering capabilities, built-in routing,
  and using Context as an alternative to Redux for global state management. Overall positive experience with the
  framework although handling image media queries with javascript isn't as good compared to create-react-app. 
- First time using Tailwind CSS. Frustrating to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes
  easy to use and preferable to regular CSS. 
- First time using Sanity and headless CMS. Greatly simplified the backend work compared to a Express/MongoDB solution.
